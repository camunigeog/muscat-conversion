"p.\g 285" in /records/30729/



Items 140709:
-------------
	- Adjust createMarcExport() to filter out those in the report with @location@ matches "Not in SPRI", i.e. those in loccamuninotinspri
	- 245 $a dotEnd is wrong. Need to remove, and change so that every record simply has a . at end of whole field if not already there
	- 245 0? where ? is the stop list like "The ", or "Der " or "An " (which would have values of 4, 4, 3 respective).

-------------
	- Fix up report_emptyabstract - needs to post-filter for *abs is blank or *abs is empty
	- The two export types, created in createMarcExport(), need to filter out those records listed at report_onorder()
		- Also extract those into a separate download also in MARC format - this is so that the librarians can work through this list offline (they cannot be imported into Voyager directly)
			- This needs to be done by date order, e.g. date=2012/06/14 shown in /records/171173/
	- Also, will need to the parser, a code and check which adds a flag for those where @location@ matches "Not in SPRI" and another @location@ field does NOT match "Cambridge University" (i.e. we don't items from other ex-Cam institutions appearing to the general public in Voyager, but bibliographers need to see them - Voyager has ability to allow staff to search on dark records)
	- Amend record_missingd() also to exclude where (status IN ('On Order', 'On Order (O/P)', 'On Order (O/S)', 'Order Cancelled', 'Received') OR location is 'Not in SPRI')
	- When analytic support (i.e. record splitting) is added in, need to deal with report_artbecomedoc() which shows c. 17,000 records that should be treated as *doc and so should not be split, but their parentage needs to be evident (i.e. currently cannot tell that it has been extracted from something else)
		- Requires note "Extracted from <*tg/*t> <*d> <*pt>"
		- Same with report_artlocationpam(); this identifies pamphlets which need to be loaded into Voyager as documents (not as an article), but where the parent title needs to be made explicit in the record itself - i.e. is cases where SPRI doesn't subscribe to the journal so will never have a match - is standalone offprint





General bugs:
-------------

# Search needs to have minimum 3 characters for each field
